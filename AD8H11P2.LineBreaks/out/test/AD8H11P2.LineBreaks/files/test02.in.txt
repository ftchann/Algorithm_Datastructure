Line
breaking,
also
known
as
word
wrapping,
is
the
process
of
breaking
a
section
of
text
into
lines
such
that
it
will
fit
in
the
available
width
of
a
page,
window
or
other
display
area.
In
text
display,
line
wrap
is
the
feature
of
continuing
on
a
new
line
when
a
line
is
full,
such
that
each
line
fits
in
the
viewable
window,
allowing
text
to
be
read
from
top
to
bottom
without
any
horizontal
scrolling.
Word
wrap
is
the
additional
feature
of
most
text
editors,
word
processors,
and
web
browsers,
of
breaking
lines
between
words
rather
than
within
words,
when
possible.
Word
wrap
makes
it
unnecessary
to
hard-code
newline
delimiters
within
paragraphs,
and
allows
the
display
of
text
to
adapt
flexibly
and
dynamically
to
displays
of
varying
sizes.
